  <li>Using area codes, combine datasets from multiple locations into a single dataset.</li>
  <li>Data pre-processing to replace null and out-of-bounds values.</li>
  <li>Data training with the chosen machine learning models.</li>
  <li>Choosing the most accurate model and putting it into practice for this dataset.</li>
</ul>
